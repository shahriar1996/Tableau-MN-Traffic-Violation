## Describe the dataset
This is a data set of various citations across Minnesota given out in two years (2019 & 2020). 
* “Citation number” column provides the ticket number of each case, and it is the primary key of the data set. 
* “Code” column represents the short description of ticket type. 
“Vehicle Make” column tells us the model of a vehicle that has received the citation. 
“Face Value” indicates the amount charged for the citation. 
“Date” and “Time” columns provide insight in to when the citation was given. 
“Vehicle Plate State” describes in which state the vehicle is registered. 
“Address”, “Neighborhoods Description”, and “Wards” give the information about where the citation was given. 
“Latitude” and “Longitude” provide the exact location where the violation occurred. These two columns could help to geographically visualize the location where the most and the least people tend to break the law.
